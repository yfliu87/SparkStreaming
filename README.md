How did changing values on the SparkSession property parameters affect the throughput and latency of the data?
The most direct impact is on the processedRowsPerSecond, more rows processed per second means higher throughput and low latency and vice versa.

What were the 2-3 most efficient SparkSession property key/value pairs? Through testing multiple variations on values, how can you tell these were the most optimal?
